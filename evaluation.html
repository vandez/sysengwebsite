<strong> Challenges</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Loading and unloading clothing objects</li>
	<p> To allow the user to pick what clothes they wanted to interact with, we had to find a method of loading/unloading clothing objects. We did this by using the Renderer component of a gameobject in Unity. When certain buttons in the UI are pressed the script in the background will stop the rendering of certain clothes or start rendering others.</p>
	<li>Using gestures to manipulate clothing</li>
	<p> Used the HoloToolKit with the scripts that facilitate the use of gestures and various helper scripts that make it more reliable. We then connected gestures with scripts that adjuts the Transform components of the clothing objects which allow them to move, rotate and resize clothing.</p>
	<li> Using the Chatbot API</li>
	<p> Had to use a class in Unity to make HTTP requests to the AI Chatbot API so we could allow users to input queries and then quickly get and displays responses with the relevant information.</p>
</ul>

<strong>Incomplete features/bugs </strong>
<ul>
	<li> The chatbot doesn't display relevant information such as the image of the product or possibly the URL of the product on the NET-A-PORTER website.</li>
	<li> The information about the clothing on the main menu isn't dynamic and is there just as concept for the clothing that we have available </li>

																				<center><h3><strong>Critical evaluation</strong></h3></center>
																				<center><h3><strong>Future work</strong></h3></center>
																				<p>Due to the fact that this project was meant as a concept for such a big company it meant we were encouraged to innovate as much as could. This has left many different avenues we could go down if we had more time with the project.</p>
<strong>Create an avatar</strong>
<p>Right now the clothes hang in the air in realistic positions but the next step would be to attach them to an avatar. We could allow the users to create an avatar true to their body shape. We would allow them to enter in values such as waist size and shoulder width and that would generate an avatar that we’d create a 3D model of and place in the gameworld. We could take this a step further and incorporate some kind of face creator. We could do this via technology that creates a 3d model from 2d photos that they would take themselves or do this via a manual creator that they would use themselves.</p>
<strong>Further use of the chatbot</strong>
<p>We could also use the API of our fellow group’s AI Chatbot further. Right now we’ve integrated it as an option within the application and provide a UI to interact with it. We could further intertwine it with our concept and use it to get live information about the 3d models of clothes that we have in the application. For example, we could have a separate UI that’s available when you select a garment that displays information such as price, name, brand, material etc.</p>
<strong>Use NET-A-PORTER's API</strong>
<p>We would like to use Net-A-Porter’s API similarly to how the Chatbot has used it. We would like to offer our application as a means of also purchasing clothes which brings it closer to a realistic proposition rather than just a concept. We could offer a basket and checkout. Allow users to search for clothes sold by Net-A-Porter and retrieve the 3D model for that garment and immediately load it from a database so that the user can view it. We would then allow them to purchase it if necessary by placing it in their basket and going through the checkout process including payment.
