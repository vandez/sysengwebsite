                We needed several hardware in order to successfully complete our project. The main hardware that we need are a 3D scanner and a VR/AR device. Before deciding on which hardware to use, we researched about what features each hardware has and compared them to their alternatives. We made sure that the platform can support the requirements that we need and that it is the most suitable for our client and user.

                <strong>Decision:</strong> We have decided to choose Sense 3D Scanner because it is affordable, takes better quality images as compared to XYZ 3D scanner and has the greatest maximum scan volume which will allow us to capture a full image of clothings including long gowns. It has the largest operating range among the three scanners which also helps us take full scans instead of taking only close-ups of the clothing. Sense also has a tripod mount so that we can attach it onto a tripod and take more stable 3D scans. Although the quality of the 3D image will not be as good as Fuel3D Scanify, it will be sufficient for our project as the small details of the garment will not be our main concern at this point. <br>

                 <strong>Decision:</strong> We have decided to choose Microsoft Hololens as it has holographic lenses that allow users to see multi-dimensional full-color holographic objects in the real world. Hololens contains advanced sensors to capture users' input and enables them to interact with the holograms in a natural way. Since Oculus Rift gives a fully immersive experience to users, we think using the Hololens would fit the brief better because it will simulate the experience of looking and trying on a piece of clothing in real life, just as a Net-a-Porter EIP shopper would. The trade-off of using Hololens as our platform is that it has a limited field of view, but the benefits of using Hololens outweighs this drawback.

                Since we have decided to use Microsoft Hololens for our project, we looked into online resources that can help us build the application. In order to build an application for Hololens, we use Unity to build 3D objects and Visual Studio for debugging and deploying apps. We also installed Hololens Emulator which allows us to run applications in a virtual machine without a Hololens.<br>
                <br>Adding features such as voice input and gesture can be implemented by using the APIs that are already built in Unity. Scripts in Unity are written in C#. These scripts are what enables the app to respond to input from the user, create graphical effects and control the physical behaviour of objects.<br>
                <br>Aside from Unity and Visual Studio, we are also implementing Vuforia - an SDK for Unity - which enables us to create holographic applications that can recognise specific things in the environment so that we can attach actions on the specific objects. This is useful as our app needs to be able to recognise user's body and morph the clothing onto the body.
                <br><br>In order to enable Vuforia to work with the Hololens spatial mapping and positional tracking systems, we need to enable "extended tracking" on a target and bind the AR Camera to the Hololens scene camera. This feature is handled automatically between the Vuforia SDK and Hololens API in Unity without interference from the developer. Here is the sequence of processes that occurs when extended tracking is enabled on a target:
                <br><ol style="margin-left: 50px;">
                    <li>Vuforia's target tracker recognises the target</li>
                    <li>Target tracking is initialised</li>
                    <li>The position and rotation of the target are analyzed to provide a robust pose estimate for HoloLens to use</li>
                    <li>Vuforia transforms the target's pose into the HoloLens spatial mapping coordinate space</li>
                    <li>HoloLens takes over tracking and the Vuforia tracker is deactivated</li>
                            </ol>
                To implement Extended Tracking in Unity, the corresponding checkbox in the Inspector should be checked.

                <br>If the application must dynamically enable or disable the extended tracking at run time, we can use the Extended Tracking API's startExtendedTracking and stopExtendedTracking methods as illustrated in the following code example:
